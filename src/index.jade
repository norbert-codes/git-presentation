            h3 Git is a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">Version Control System</a>

        h2 What is "version control"?

            h3.emphasize Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

        ul

            h3. It allows you to:
          li revert files back to a previous state
          li revert the entire project
          li compare changes over time
          li see who modified something that might be causing a problem
          li
            h4 generally, if you screw things up, you can easily recover
          li
            h4 <em>and of course you can't overwrite each others work</em>

      section
        h2 How does this work?
        ul
          li
          li Git is a Distributed Version Control System, where clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files: they fully mirror the repository.
          li If any server dies repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it.

        h2 Snapshots baby!
        ul
          li
          li <strong>others:</strong> information as a list of file-based changes
          li <strong>Git:</strong> "set of snapshots of a miniature filesystem"
          li <small>Git takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored.</small>

        ul
          li
          li Remember? You have the whole database mirrored.
          li For example, to browse the history of the project.
          li You can see the changes introduced between the current version of a file and the file a month ago instantly.


      section
        h2 The three states
        ul
          li
          li <strong>comitted</strong> (safely stored in local database)
          li <strong>modified</strong> (you changed it, but not stored in database yet)
          li <strong>staged</strong> (changed and marked to be in next commit)
          li <strong>+ pushed</strong> (copied to the remote repository from local database)
          li three main sections of a Git project: the Git directory, the working directory, and the staging area

          li files can be in two states: <strong>tracked or untracked</strong>
          li tracked files were in the last snapshot; they either <strong>unmodified,</strong> <strong>modified,</strong> or <strong>staged</strong>
          li as you edit files, Git sees them as <strong>modified,</strong> because you’ve changed them since your last commit
          li stage modified files and then <strong>commit all your staged changes,</strong> and the cycle repeats
